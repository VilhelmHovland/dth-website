# Intellectual History

In this text I will be discussing the role of digital technologies in the field of intellectual history. Intellectual history is a historical field concerned with the entirety of human intellectual practices, thoughts and ideas, and their historical contexts and interrelationships. This is not limited to just historical intellectuals like philosophers and other scholars, but can concern itself with popular thought and general intellectual practices. The field is characterized less by its research object, as it is extremely broad, and more by the methodological approach, characterized by contextualization, both synchronically and diachronically in history. The sources for research can be any kind of intellectual artifact, but the foremost kind is that of historical text.

The foremost digital technology to impact intellectual history is digitized historical material. Digitized collections of historical text have provided researchers with unprecedented access to research material for study, circumventing previous logistical limitations. Digitization projects for historical text are undertaken both by private actors and governmental institutions. A notable example of the former is the Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), assembled and hosted by the education publishing company Gale. This corpus comprises published material in Britain in the eighteenth century, assembled through digitally scanning microfilm copies or original copies of texts from various partners, including the University of Oxford. and is not freely available to the public, but many institutions such as the Computational History Group at the University of Helsinki base their research on this corpus. Due to it's large size and scope, as of 2025 having surpassed 200'000 documents, it's considered an excellent tool for researchers of the British enlightenment. A good example of digitization projects by government institutions is that of the [National Library of Norway](https://nb.no), which since 2006 has continuously been working to digitize the entirety of their collection, including works of multiple mediums. This collection, stretching from the middle ages to today, contains at this point almost one million books, half a million periodicals, and over four million newspapers, making it one of the world's most impressive text digitization projects in terms of coverage. Moreover, these materials are, with the exception of recent publications covered by copyright restrictions, freely available to the public via the National Library's digital library on their website. Researchers can also gain access to the copyrighted material for research purpouses. Many other governmental institutions in other countries have similar digitization projects including Denmark's [Royal Library](https://kb.dk). Digital text collections like ECCO and the Norwegian National Library's digital library are overwhelmingly used by researchers in Intellectual History for easy access to historical text material across borders.

Accompanying the digital technology of digitized text collections is that of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, technology that identifies text on images and outputs machine readable and searchable text. Though rarely directly used by intellectual historians themselves, searchable digital versions of historical texts are often used in research. Many, if not most, digital text collections use OCR on their collections in order to provide such versions of the documents, including both ECCO and the Norwegian National Library. This allows researchers to more effectively search through these collections, not only by document metadata but by the documents' contents, in order to find source material of interest. OCR is however a fairly challenging technological task, and the kind of material of interest to intellectual historians is particularly difficult. Due to historical documents frequently containing archaic and/or handwritten script, messy formatting, and even damage or wear on the pages, faulty OCR is a major challenge for researchers working with OCR-versions of documents, posing both practical and methodological challenges for historians, as discussed for example in Ryan (2017). 

These two technologies can simply be used by researchers as conveniences within their traditional methodologies, but there are also digital technologies that serve as the basis for entirely new research methodologies and research outputs, often referred to as Digital History. First and foremost, searchable digitized text collections have introduced quantitative and statistical methodologies to intellectual history. As outlined in Moretti (2013), "distant reading" can provide insights into large text collections at scale, as opposed to the traditional "close reading" of individual texts. This potential is attractive to intellectual historians, as it allows for the study of intellectual developments in broad perspective, circumventing historical canon and other selection bias and covering a broad body of material. van Eijnatten and Ros (2019) is one example of intellectual historians using quantitative computational methods to study historical changes in concepts in digitized searchable corpora. Additionally, this article as well as Heuser (2023) show intellectual historians using more advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods for more advanced quantitative representations and comparisons of the data, in both cases training and employing embedding models for linguistic representations of the concepts in question.

Beyond new methodologies in Digital History, intellectual historians have also started using digital technologies for new ways of visualizing and representing history. These can be either simply with the goal of representing the results of quantitative research, or be tools developed to aid research in new projects. An example of the former is the visualizations in Stanford University's ["Mapping the Republic of Letters" project](http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/publications/), displaying the result of finding correspondence networks based on digitized historical letters with interactive map graphs. An example of the latter is the University of Helsinki Digital History group's [Reception Reader](https://receptionreader.com/), described in Rosson et al. (2023), which is based on the aforementioned ECCO corpus. This is a tool for researchers where based on a document query instances of text reuse are displayed on a graph. These instances can be quotations or outright plagiarizing and anything in between, and one can either look for reuse of the query document in later publishings, or documents from which the query document reuses text published before. This network visualization can be used by intellectual historians to examine this type of link between publications in the eighteenth century, for example to study intellectual influences between writers and works. This can either support their current research or even suggest new avenues for research. These examples show the impact that digital technologies have had on intellectual history not only in offering new methodologies but also in providing visualizations and tools to shape the type of research outputs from the field.

Though these technologies as described offer exciting new opportunities for intellectual historians, they only stand to complement traditional work in the field, not so much replace or disrupt the classic types of research in the field. Quantitative NLP methods provide a very different perspective on the historical materials compared to traditional hermeneutical close-reading, which offers significantly more advanced insight into the intellectual significance of individual texts. Intellectual History concerns itself with intellectual features within individual works or authorships as much as broad patterns in historical epochs, so research projects where analogue close-reading is the obligatory research method are a stable aspect of the field, which digital technologies can not challenge. However, for research questions examining clearly searchable features such as key concepts, digital technologies can certainly provide opportunities to complement traditional methodologies. Beyond the ability to access and search through digital text collections and understanding the limitations and opportunities of digital OCR documents, I would not say much in the way of digital skills are absolutely necessary to thrive in intellectual history. Instead, the digital technmologies described in this text certainly offer exciting opportunities for novel methodologies and projects to complement traditional practices, and an increasing number of researchers, institutions and students are developing competence with Digital History and its new methodologies and practices.

In this text I have provided an overview of the types of applications of digital technologies in the field of intellectual history. These include the digital historical collections which are frequently utilized by historians for easy access to historical material and for searchable OCR version of documents, and new methodologies and visualizations from Digital History playing an increasing role in this field. Lastly I discuss the importance of digital skills in intellectual history, where I argue that, though not exactly obligatory, digital technologies can allow for entirely new methodologies or results to complement traditional practices.
