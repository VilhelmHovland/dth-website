The aim of this website is to present the field of Intellectual History, as well as outline the ways in which digital technologies play a role in it. It is also the exam submission for the course in Digital Technologies in the Humanities (E25.129222U010.A) at Aarhus University. 

In addition to this home page, the website has pages for some of the topics covered by the course, as well as examples.
