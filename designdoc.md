## Website Overview

The aim of this website is to present the field of Intellectual History, as well as outline the ways in which digital technologies play a role in it. It is also the exam submission for the course in Digital Technologies in the Humanities (E25.129222U010.A) at Aarhus University. 

In addition to this home page, the website has pages for some of the topics covered by the course, as well as examples. Each page has its associated html file, but loads the text matter from the respective markdown file. The styling is defined in the dthwebsite.css CSS file, and the whole website is deployed with GitHub Pages [here](https://vilhelmhovland.github.io/dth-website/index.html)

This homepage is based in index.html, using designdoc.md for text content.

The "Digital Technologies in Intellectual History" page provides an introduction to my academic field, as well as an outline of some of the ways in which digital technologies are playing a part in its methodology. It is based on intellectualhistorypage.html and intellectualhistorypage.md.

The "APIs" page gives an introduction to APIs and discusses some APIs relevant for Intellectual History. There is an implementation of the Europeana search API that can be called to find an image from the cultural heritage database. This page is based on apipage.html and apipage.md.

The "GitHub" page gives an introduction to GitHub as a tool for facilitating transparent and reproducible research, and describes one repository for a tool useful for Intellectual History. It is based on githubpage.html and githubpage.md.
